We made a platformer game for Ludum Dare 43 and I mainly worked on the enemies.

All enemies:

- Patrol when they cannot see the player.
- Attack when they see the player.
- Have a wind up timer before they attack. This timer is different for each enemy.
- Detect the end of the ground or when blocked by a wall and flip to the opposite direction in both cases.

Differences between enemies:

- Enemy1: Shoots the palyer every 2 seconds.
- Enemy2: Jumps towards the palyer every 2 seconds.
- Enemy3: Charges at the player every 2 seconds.
